Now I saw a man stand up one day and fight to save his 
life, just a common worker,
supporting his kids and wife, he 
put a plug in his jug things looked
up for sure but the whole damn
thing of it was there is no blasted cure

Chorus:
I've seen a few men go 
"The Road of the Righteous" 
and a few have traveled 
"This Old Lonely Path"
I've seen a few men go
"The Road and the Righteous" 
by God I'm sure we'll see some more
"Go Their Blessed Way"

hey it's gonna, take some foot work to
get you on your way, they'll 
be pit-faults and some cat-calls but
hard you must persist, cause life 
is so prescious ad we have
only got one shot, so if you
move along and you stay God
strong all the treasures will be got

Chorus
