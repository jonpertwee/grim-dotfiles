I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They’re moving into the street 

Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire’s still alight
They’re burning into the night 

There’s too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there’s not much love to go around
Can’t you see this is a land of confusion? 

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we’re given
Use them and let’s start trying
To make it a place worth living in 

Oh, superman, where are you now?
When everything’s gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, these men of power
Are losing control by the hour 

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there’s not much love to go around
Tell me why this is a land of confusion 

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we’re given
Use them and let’s start trying
To make it a place worth living in 

I remember long ago
I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
