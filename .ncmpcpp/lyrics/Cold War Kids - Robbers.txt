Sulking, walking round' the city after dark
Need protection, from street toughs who clip the locks and rip the doors off rough, like cowards

Oh this life of glorified
Robbing from the blind is not easy, you see
Don't think I don't know sympathy
My victims in my shadow staring back at me

Not me, I'm knockin
Tiptoe outside a stranger's door casually let myself in
Fill pockets with trinkets, purses, china, antique armoire

Oh this life of glorified
Robbing from the blind is not easy, you see
Don't think I don't know sympathy
My victims in my shadow staring back at me

There's robbers in my thoughts!
They tell me what to think, they're hiding in my clothes, crawling in the kitchen sink
