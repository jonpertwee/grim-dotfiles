Just as the sand made everything round
Just as the tar seeps up from the ground 
Bitter dancer, ever turning
So was the day that you came to town

You took a room and you settled in
Washed off the chalk from your weathered skin
Daylight sleeper
Bloody reaper
You took a room and you settled in

I should have known one day you would come
All of us walk so blind in the sun
Midnight feeder, beggar pleader
I should had known one day you would come

Tell me again my only son
Tell me again what have you done

At arm's lengths
I will hold you there
There

At arm's length
I will hold you there
There
