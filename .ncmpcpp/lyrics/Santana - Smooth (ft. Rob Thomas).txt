Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood, yeah
'Cause you're so smooth

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave, it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out, yeah
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you 'round and 'round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood, yeah
'Cause you're so smooth

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
Yeah

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it, yeah

Or else forget about it
Oh, or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Oh, let's don't forget about it, yeah
Let's don't forget about it, yeah, oh no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, oh no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, yeah, oh no
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Yeah, yeah
