Well there's nothing more to add before I leave
This thing of ours is dead but don't you grieve
Is it me or are they younger every night?
Just because they can it doesn't make it all right

I'm hanging by my teeth waiting on quick relief
While the kids don't sleep for days
I could die in a hundred odd ways

And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
It's a shame or a sham he's half as old as I am
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried

Well it terrifies the life from out of me
It's really such a lazy way to be

Hiding in the bedroom climbing up the walls
You've got to kick it out of me gently
Till it begs and pleads and crawls

And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
It's a shame or a sham he's half as old as I am
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried

And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
It's a shame or a sham he's half as old as I am
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried

And wont you make sure
My mother gets half my weight in gold
Tell her I just did what I was told
Grab your expensive coat and bury it inside
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
